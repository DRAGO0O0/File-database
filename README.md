A git project is being developed to create a "file" database with several "tables". Each "table" is a separate JSON file containing a list of JSON objects with the same structure. Access and manipulation of the database is carried out through the console menu, which will work until the "exit" option is selected. The project supports standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and also implements several specific queries for accessing and searching data in accordance with the option.

Project requirements:

The implementation of CRUD operations must be performed by separate functions that will be universal for all tables and implemented only once.
Table content must contain at least 20 records.
Additional functionality:
Calculation of the average score for a subject or for each student.
Displays students and subjects for which grades are below a specified value (the value is specified by the user).
Conclusion of good students who only have grades 4 and/or 5.
Project objectives:

Task 1: Developing a console menu
Implement a console menu with options for executing various commands.
Instead of actually executing commands, for now, print sentences like "I'm doing this."

Task 2: Development of the “business logic and database RAM” block
Develop a mechanism for storing entities in RAM and their accurate output in the form of a table to the console.
Use a suitable data type to store entities.
Create a layer between the files and the console.

Task 3: Development of a general block for working with files
Implement CRUD operations for working with files.
Break the code into separate functions for convenience.

Task 4: Implementation of query command execution
Populate JSON files with data to demonstrate the functionality of the additional functionality that matches the variant.
Use conditions, loops, and various data types in Python to perform queries and manipulate data.
